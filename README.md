TruSource faces customer churn, which directly impacts profitability. Since retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, our objective was to predict which customers are most likely to churn and provide actionable business recommendations to improve retention.Using historical customer data, we built a supervised classification model to identify high-risk customers and uncover key drivers of churn.
Key result:
The final XGBoost model achieved a strong ROC-AUC of 0.8937, outperforming logistic regression and random forest.
Month-to-month contracts, lack of referrals, early tenure, high monthly charges, and electronic check payments were major churn drivers.
Customers with 3+ referrals, dependents, longer contracts, and multiple services had significantly lower churn rates.
